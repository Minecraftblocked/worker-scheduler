# DTS User Guide

Congrats! You just saved yourself hours of work by bootstrapping this project with DTS. Let’s get you oriented with what’s here and how to use it.

> This DTS setup is meant for developing libraries (not apps!) that can be published to NPM. If you’re looking to build a Node app, you could use `ts-node-dev`, plain `ts-node`, or simple `tsc`.
